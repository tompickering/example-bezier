# Example Bezier Curve Drawing
This is a minimalistic program which simply draws two Bezier curves to the screen - a quadratic curve and a cubic curve.
Requires SDL2.

## Note on 'example-' repositories
None of my repositories beginning with 'example-' are intended to be useful pieces of software - rather, they exist to illustrate fun and interesting principles in a complete context. The purpose is simply to show how these sorts of things can be acheived, such that others might be able to deepen their understanding of certain algorithms or the utilities and techniques used to implement them. As such, the files are very thoroughly commented, ocasionally with tangential information such as justifications for design decisions etc. By the same token, I wrote these small programs to develop my own understanding in the first place, so if you can offer any constructuve criticism of my code, or if there's anywhere that I've done anything horifically inefficiently and there is a much simpler and clearer way of writing something then please let me know or throw a pull request my way - it's always greatly appreciated!
